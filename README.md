# orbel

**orbel** is a Python program designed to help understand **orbital elements** by visualising **relative** and **absolute Keplerian orbits** in both **3D** and **2D**.  
It was originally created during my master's thesis work on astrometry, starting as a simple tool to explore orbital dynamics, and later evolved into a complete program for educational and research purposes.

##  Features
- Visualisation of **relative** and **absolute** orbits
- **3D orbit geometry** and **sky-plane projection** views
- Customisable orbital parameters via interactive sliders
- Supports both **educational use** and research presentations
